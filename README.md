# OCD-Analysis-Dashboard
A practice Tableau dashboard created to improve design and layout skills by recreating a template using data from Kaggle. Focused on achieving a clean, visually appealing design while maintaining clarity and easy interpretation of insights.

## Project
This project is a practice dashboard where I recreated a design template using a Kaggle dataset. The goal was to refine my dashboard design skills, making it visually appealing while keeping the insights clear, easy to read, and easy to understand.

After downloading the dataset from Kaggle, I created the individual visualizations to display my insights and then created my background image using Figma design. I then carefully arranged all the visualizations to fit the dashboard design I had.
